Plan of different stuff to try



IEEE9_Ver4
1Hz bound - Original setup with "frequency regulation settling above nominal and then slowly converges to nominal value


IEEE9_Ver5
I modified all gen_intertia values to be in the right base.
Same exact setup as in Ver4, except H values for all generators.

IEEE9_Ver6
I modified all internal Gen model parameters to match the info in the table Harry shared on Slack. This is mainly to see if any internal info about the generator is causing any impact on the observed behavior.


IEEE9_Ver7
Here we go back to IEEE9_Ver4 settings, and we "omit" the exciter
This did not work --> got error! but by looking at the fist 20 mins before the error, it did not solve/improve/help with the problem!


IEEE9_Ver8
So now, we will go back to ver4 and turn off AGC.


IEEE9_Ver10
This is based on Ver 4, but we set back all cranking times to original values. Ver10 is for the case of no freq limit.

IEEE9_Ver11
This is the same setup as in IEEE9_Ver10 except that the plan used is the one for 1.5 Hz limit

IEEE9_Ver12
This is the same setup as in IEEE9_Ver10 except that the plan used is the one for 1 Hz limit


IEEE9_Ver13
This is built on top of IEEE9_Ver12
In this case, we added one BESS at Bus 5.


IEEE9_Ver14
This is built on top of IEEE9_Ver13.
In this case, we added a plant controller to the BESS to see if change_pref and change_qvref functions will work.


IEEE9_Ver15
This is built on top of IEEE9_Ver13.
The BESS bus (Bus 5) code is changed to 2 (PV bus). The scheduled voltage was modified to Vscheduled = 1.015057 pu
